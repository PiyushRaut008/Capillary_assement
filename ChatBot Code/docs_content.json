Know about API URL structure, host URL and headers API URL structure The below image displays Capillary API structure with an example: The resource ID is a combination of the Entity and the action you tell the API to perform. In this case, adding a customer is the entity and add is the action. For more information on entities, see Entities management . Host URLs A host is a server to which the API calls are made, usually the API cluster URL. The host URLs are the same for both v1.1, v2, and v3 APIs. However, the v1 APIs mentioned in the documentation have different URLs for each entity. You can see those URLs under the respective section. Cluster Host URL Asia https://apac.intouch.capillarytech.com Europe https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com US https://ushc.intouch.capillarytech.com Asia 2 (South East Asia) https://sea.intouch.capillarytech.com Request Headers Header Description Value Accept Request format from the server side application/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format Content-Type Representation of data at the client side. application/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format User-Agent A characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent. Format \\{product\\} {product-version} \\{comment\\} Example: User-Agent: Mozilla\\{version\\} ({system-information}) \\{platform\\} ({platform-details}) \\{extensions\\} CAP-API-ACCESS-TOKEN Unique access token generated with the Key and Secret combination. Applicable for OAuth based authentication. Generated token value. X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE Till or store from which you want to post the data. This is applicable for the OAuth authentication only. TILL, STORE_CODE, STORE_NAME, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_1, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_2. The default value is TILL . X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE Value of the specified entity type. Example: If X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE is STORE_CODE , then X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE is the store code that you want to tag to POST data. By default, it considers the Till associated with the client key and secret. X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP-TYPE: \\{name} X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP: \\{value} Supported only for v2 APIs: Lets you submit requests on behalf of other TILLs (active TILLs) instead of the authenticating till. In db, the combination of attribution_lookup and lookup_code are mapped to TILL ids and org ids. When a new POST request is placed with the combination of a lookup name and lookup code, the data will be inserted in the db on behalf of the TILL that is mapped to the specified combination. NOTE: * It is recommended to use OAuth authentication. Accepted values are WECHAT and MOBILE_TRIGGER. Response headers Parameter Description X-Cap-Requestid A unique ID generated for every promotional request. This ID is sent in the response headers and can be used to track the request and its response end-to-end. For batch transactions, this ID tracks the entire API call, including all promotions processed within the batch. x-cap-api-request-uri This standardises endpoint identification by exposing the URI pattern in a response header instead of the raw URI, enabling cleaner metrics, better observability, and easier debugging. Example: Request → GET /v1/promotions/customer/12345 Response header → x-cap-api-request-uri: /v1/promotions/customer/customerId API version Capillary's APIs are divided into four versions: v1 v1.1 v2 v3 These versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of: new sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and upgraded versions of existing APIs. The v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The V2 and V3 APIs are developed in JSON. Additional features of v2 and v3 APIs The list below highlights the additional features that v2 and v3 APIs support compared to v1 and v1.1 APIs: Provide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook. Support multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls. Merge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID. NOTE: By default, all the API versions are enabled for the organisations across clusters. Organization setup An organization associated with Capillary is registered in Intouch. Based on the organization’s architecture, store TILL or Store Center accounts are created besides zones, concepts, and stores. Only Capillary users have access to register an organization in inTouch. For more information, contact your Account Manager or Delivery Manager of Capillary. To set up an organization as a Capillary admin, see Setting up Organization . Table of Contents HTTP methods Know about API URL structure, host URL and headers API URL structure Host URLs Request Headers Response headers API version Additional features of v2 and v3 APIs Organization setup"

Capillary APIs. Capillary APIs are structured following the REST model. Our APIs use HTTPS protocol and support requests and responses in JSON format. HTTP methods The HTTP methods used in Capillary APIs are as follows: Command Description POST To create a new resource. PUT To update an existing resource. GET To retrieve a resource. DELETE To delete a resource. PATCH To partially update an existing resource. Know about API URL structure, host URL and headers API URL structure The below image displays Capillary API structure with an example: The resource ID is a combination of the Entity and the action you tell the API to perform. In this case, adding a customer is the entity and add is the action. For more information on entities, see Entities management . Host URLs A host is a server to which the API calls are made, usually the API cluster URL. The host URLs are the same for both v1.1, v2, and v3 APIs. However, the v1 APIs mentioned in the documentation have different URLs for each entity. You can see those URLs under the respective section. Cluster Host URL Asia https://apac.intouch.capillarytech.com Europe https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com US https://ushc.intouch.capillarytech.com Asia 2 (South East Asia) https://sea.intouch.capillarytech.com Request Headers Header Description Value Accept Request format from the server side application/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format Content-Type Representation of data at the client side. application/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format User-Agent A characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent. Format \\{product\\} {product-version} \\{comment\\} Example: User-Agent: Mozilla\\{version\\} ({system-information}) \\{platform\\} ({platform-details}) \\{extensions\\} CAP-API-ACCESS-TOKEN Unique access token generated with the Key and Secret combination. Applicable for OAuth based authentication. Generated token value. X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE Till or store from which you want to post the data. This is applicable for the OAuth authentication only. TILL, STORE_CODE, STORE_NAME, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_1, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_2. The default value is TILL . X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE Value of the specified entity type. Example: If X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE is STORE_CODE , then X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE is the store code that you want to tag to POST data. By default, it considers the Till associated with the client key and secret. X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP-TYPE: \\{name} X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP: \\{value} Supported only for v2 APIs: Lets you submit requests on behalf of other TILLs (active TILLs) instead of the authenticating till. In db, the combination of attribution_lookup and lookup_code are mapped to TILL ids and org ids. When a new POST request is placed with the combination of a lookup name and lookup code, the data will be inserted in the db on behalf of the TILL that is mapped to the specified combination. NOTE: * It is recommended to use OAuth authentication. Accepted values are WECHAT and MOBILE_TRIGGER. Response headers Parameter Description X-Cap-Requestid A unique ID generated for every promotional request. This ID is sent in the response headers and can be used to track the request and its response end-to-end. For batch transactions, this ID tracks the entire API call, including all promotions processed within the batch. x-cap-api-request-uri This standardises endpoint identification by exposing the URI pattern in a response header instead of the raw URI, enabling cleaner metrics, better observability, and easier debugging. Example: Request → GET /v1/promotions/customer/12345 Response header → x-cap-api-request-uri: /v1/promotions/customer/customerId API version Capillary's APIs are divided into four versions: v1 v1.1 v2 v3 These versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of: new sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and upgraded versions of existing APIs. The v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The V2 and V3 APIs are developed in JSON. Additional features of v2 and v3 APIs The list below highlights the additional features that v2 and v3 APIs support compared to v1 and v1.1 APIs: Provide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook. Support multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls. Merge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID.

InTouch is deployed in different clusters. Before accessing InTouch, you need to know the cluster of your org and login credentials provided by Capillary. The following are the links to different clusters of InTouch: EU : https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com India : https://intouch.capillary.co.in APAC2 : https://apac2.intouch.capillarytech.com/ SG : https://sgcrm.cc.capillarytech.com/ CN : http://intouch.capillarytech.cn.com/ US : https://north-america.intouch.capillarytech.com You can access InTouch in three different ways: Using Capillary InTouch email Id and Password Using Capillary's Official Google account credentials Using SSO You can also enable two-factor authentication (MFA) for your org. To enable this, raise a JIRA ticket with the Capillary Product Support team. If SSO is enabled, Two-factor authentication will not be considered. Login with Capillary Credentials Get Started with Capillary InTouch! InTouch is a cloud-based platform that contains the entire product modules, including Organization settings and Workbench. InTouch can be accessed by all authorized users and brands. There are several user roles on InTouch and access is managed at the page level. Not everyone will have write access or access to all modules. Super Admins will provide access to users based on their role and scope. Enter the credentials provided by Capillary in Email Id and Password then click on Sign in. Login with Capillary Google account You can now sign in to InTouch using your Capillary Google Workspace account. That means: No need to remember your Intouch password anymore No more Intouch password reset every month Convenience and security Prerequisite You should have a Capillary Google Workspace account (e-mail address with domain capillarytech.com) Login with Google Credentials In a browser, open the URL of your cluster. EU Cluster - https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com/auth/login SG Cluster - https://apac2.intouch.capillarytech.com/auth/login India Cluster - https://intouch.capillary.co.in/auth/login Click on Sign in with Google as shown below. Enter the email ID your Capillary Google Workspace account and click Next . Enter your password and click Next . You will see Intouch Workbench. If you have already signed in to your Capillary Google Workspace account, you will directly see the Workbech page. Login with SSO Sign in with a single set of credentials used for multiple applications provided by third party like Microsoft ADFS, G Suite SAML. It allows brand users to login to Capillary Intouch using their Identity Provider (IdP). Setup SSO with Okta We have partnered with Okta for the integration. SSO setup requires configuring a connection for Capillary in Org’s IdP and setting up Org’s Identity in Okta Admin Console. To set up SSO with Okta, follow these steps. Step 1 - Set up a connection for Capillary in Org’s IdP Capillary PoC has to send an email to the Capillary access team with a request to set up SSO for the organization providing the following information. Organization name and ID Email domain of the organization. For example, the domain is org.com if the Email Id is [email protected] Capillary Access team will share the following information, which should be shared with the org PoC Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL. Service Provider (SP) Entity ID or Audience URL or Entity ID. User profile attributes need to be passed as SAML assertion - email, first name, and last name. Email ID mandatory. [Optional] Attribute that defines if the user has access to Capillary. For example, group, organization. This is required if the org wants to define which employees have access to Capillary. Org PoC will use the above information to create a connection for Capillary in their IdP and respond with the following information. Identity Provider SSO URL. Identity Provider Entity ID. Identity Provider Certificate signature. To know about the SAML terminologies, read How SAML works? Step 2 - Setting up Identity Provider in Capillary Capillary or Org PoC will share the information provided in step 1.3 (above) with the Capillary Access team. Capillary Access team will add an Identity Provider in Okta Admin Console and respond with setup confirmation. Step 3 - Provide Capillary application’s access to Org users Use Data Import to add Org users to the Capillary application with the appropriate access level. When you add users on InTouch, a verification email is sent along with the password setup link. The required change to disable the step is in progress and will be released soon. Until then, only Data Import to add Org users. Step 4 - Authenticate with Single Sign-on Once setup is completed, the org users can authenticate using SSO as explained in the following steps. On the new sign-in page, click Sign in with SSO. In Username , enter a valid email address and click Next . You are redirected to the Identity provider’s page to complete authentication. On the Identity Provider’s page, enter your registered email address, password, and click Sign in . When the login is successful, you will see the InTouch home page. Configuring two-factor authentication (MFA) To enable two-factor authentication, raise a JIRA ticket with the Capillary Product Support team. If SSO is enabled, two-factor authentication will not be required. To configure the two-factor authentication settings, follow these steps: Navigate to Intouch > Organization Setup > Authentication Configurations . In the Validity Period For 2 Factor Authentication (in days) field, define how long a user's 2FA authentication remains valid before they need to re-authenticate using 2FA. Example: If set to 1 day, a user who logs in with 2FA today won't need to go through 2FA again for the next 24 hours. The maximum number of days that you can set is 90. In the Validity Period For OTP Expiration (in minutes) field, define how long a One-Time Password (OTP) remains valid before it expires. Example: If set to 15 minutes, an OTP sent to a user's email or phone will expire after 15 minutes if not used. The maximum allowed time is 15 minutes. In the Validity Period For Login Session (in hours) field, define how long a user's login session remains active before they are automatically logged out due to inactivity. Example: If set to 24 hours, a user who logs in will remain logged in for 24 hours unless they manually log out or the session expires due to inactivity. The maximum allowed time is 24 hours.

The different types of entities in Capillary platform are: Customer : A customer is an individual who either buys goods/services or subscribes to the organization’s newsletters. An organization refers to a store, business firm, hospital, or restaurant. See v2 customer APIs and v1.1 customer APIs . Transactions : A transaction represents a purchase or return event. The parameters for transaction APIs are configuration dependent. See more details v2 transaction APIs and v1.1 transaction APIs . Store : The store entity holds information about an organization's stores and hierarchy. This entity provides APIs to manage stores. To know more, see Store APIs . Product : The product entity holds all products of an org and product-related information such as size, color, type, and brand. Product APIs allow you to fetch details of a specific product, modify existing details, change a product's brand name, and create new attributes for a product. See Product APIs . Behavioral Events : Behavioral events help capture customer activities such as registration, forgot passwords, and cart abandonment. You can create custom events, fetch event data, configure event fields, and do more with Events APIs . Card : Cards are loyalty identifiers and enable orgs t o run card-based memberships. Cards are associated with a card series and each customer can have multiple cards. A card number or an card external ID is a unique identifier of a customer and is used in fetching customer details. See more about Cards APIs. User Group : The new user group (v2) solves the use cases of both B2B loyalty and B2C loyalty unlike the previous version which was designed for B2C cases. This entity contains APIs to manage user groups. See more about User Group. Leads : A lead is a purchase an individual is interested in, especially for offline stores. Leads can be created for both loyalty and non-loyalty customers. This entity provides you the APIs to create, manage and fetch leads. See more about Leads APIs. . Extended Fields Extended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions). An extended field is a predefined field with an id, name, entity type, label name, and data type. Example: GUID, IMEI, making changes, and so on. Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item. 📘 Extended fields are created in the backend. You can just use whatever is required for you. to show or hide it on the UI. The following are the topics discussed in this article. Entity Types Supported Entity Types: customer, regular_transaction, return_transaction, not_interested_transaction, not_interested_return_transaction, regular_lineitem, return_lineitem, not_interested_lineitem, not_interested_return_lineitem. Data Type Supported Data types: integer, string, double, date-time, standard_enum, custom_enum i. Standard Enum: Consists of predefined values that are common for any org. In the DB table, an extended field with the type standard_enum is mapped to one or more values. ii. Custom Enum: Consists of predefined values for each field and each value is mapped to a specific org. A value can be mapped to different orgs. The following example shows the values of an extended field are mapped to different orgs (scope_ids). JSON id: 1 ef_id: 9 scope_id: 797 value: 他他他他 created_by: -1 created_on: 2017-03-23 15:18:16 modified_by: -1 modified_on: 2017-03-23 15:18:16 *************************** 2. row *************************** id: 2 ef_id: 9 scope_id: 1115 value: 他他他 created_by: -1 created_on: 2017-03-23 15:22:39 modified_by: -1 modified_on: 2017-03-23 15:22:39 Properties of Extended Fields Following are the properties of extended fields. The combination of name and entity type for extended fields should be unique Extended fields are not case-sensitive Mapping of Extended Fields On a broader view, extended fields are mapped to vertical ids, and vertical ids are mapped to org ids as shown in the following diagram. Verticals and Vertical IDs A vertical is a group that defines the nature of the business. An org can have multiple verticals mapped to it. For example, if an org ABC sells fitness items and apparel, and another org XYZ sells stationery and sports items, both orgs have one common vertical – sports. Following are the properties of verticals: Each vertical is mapped to the relevant set of extended fields The vertical name should be unique across the table Mapping Extended Fields and Vertical Ids Following are the properties of extended fields and vertical ids mapping: Each extended field can only be mapped to one vertical id One vertical id can be mapped to multiple extended fields An extended field with vertical id ‘-1’ is available for all the orgs. These are global fields and can be used by any org Mapping Vertical IDs and Org Following are the properties of vertical ids and org ids mapping table Org and verticals have a many-to-many mapping An org cannot use an extended field that is not within the verticals associated with it. Any org can use extended fields with the vertical id ‘-1’ ( fields) Validation Rules A validation rule can contain a logical or regex expression that evaluates the extended field values. Validation rules verify whether a field value meets the defined standards before saving it to the Mongo DB. That is, If a rule is applied on an extended field, a validation check is performed whenever the field value is received. Once the field value is validated successfully, it will be saved to the Mongo DB. Examples for logical rules: >, <, >=, <=, = We first create rules (>, <) and then map each rule to the extended fields. Following are the properties of validation rules: Multiple rules can be applied to an extended field One rule can be applied to different fields Other Validations Apart from the rules validation, scope validation is also performed which is defined in the DB tables Extended fields with custom enum values can be used only by orgs that are mapped to it An org can use only extended fields that are mapped to it through vertical ids Extended fields with vertical id mapping as -1 can be used by any org Data fields Standard Fields : These are fields created for a specific module to capture basic details. This could be fields at customer level, transaction level, line-item level, coupon level and so on. Standard fields are created by Capillary and are available by default for each module. Extended Fields : Extended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields. Developers control the field names, data types, enum values, and scopes for the extended fields and can capture values based on rules (logical or regex expressions). See more about Extended fields . Custom Fields : As the name suggests there are custom fields that orgs need to capture for a specific module. It could be of any datatype and value. Reporting is not possible on custom field values. See more about Custom fields. Extended Fields Extended Fields are proposed fields to standardize input values and keys across organizations. These fields make it easier for the Development and Analytics teams to get rid of the complex data that flows into the database, through existing custom fields.

An extended field is a predefined field with an id, name, entity type, label name, and data type. Example: GUID, IMEI, making changes, and so on. Extended fields are used in customer registration, profile update, transaction, and transaction line item. When an extended field is added to collect additional information, it starts accumulating data within our system. However, this data isn’t immediately visible in the user interface for audience creation. If you want to build an audience using filters based on the information stored in these extended fields, you need to raise a request to the Customer Success Team to create these filters. Once implemented, you can use these filters to create audiences. For more information refer audience creation using filters . 📘 Extended fields are created at the backend. You can select the fields to be displayed on the UI. The following are the topics discussed in this article. Entity Types Supported Entity Types: customer, regular_transaction, return_transaction, not_interested_transaction, not_interested_return_transaction, regular_lineitem, return_lineitem, not_interested_lineitem, not_interested_return_lineitem.

This entity includes information about each customer, ranging from essential contact details to demographic and geographic data. In addition, It also includes information about their purchase history, behavioural activities, loyalty details, the user groups they are part of, reward and coupon details and other related information. Within this framework, the source through which a customer is registered is called a customer data source. This source serves as the initial touchpoint, capturing the basic details that contribute to the making of a customer profile. Additionally, the channels available for communication with the customer are referred to as customer communication channels. These channels play a pivotal role in establishing meaningful connections and fostering effective communication with customers. Related entities A customer entity can have information related to other entities and similarly the other entities can include customer entity information. For example, card entity, and transaction entity can include information related to customer entity and vice-versa. Supported objects and fields The below image provides you with information about the supported objects and fields in the customer entity. Understanding data sources In our system, a \"Source\" refers to the origin or system from which customer information is integrated. Each source represents a unique system, integration, or data feed. Customers may be represented differently across various sources. For instance, a customer named \"Christopher\" in one source could appear as \"Christo\" in another. This discrepancy underscores the necessity for identity resolution to establish a unified and accurate view of the customer. Data integration involves collecting information from different sources, including identifiers, subscription statuses, and email addresses. This process merges and creates a consolidated, reliable customer profile. When the system receives information from the same identifier already present but from a different source, it analyzes, merges , and adds it to the existing customer profile under a different source. On Member Care, within the customer profile, you can view all the sources from which the customer registered. Supported data sources The entity supports the following data sources: Facebook Web_engage WeChat Instore E-Commerce Website Line Mobile-APp Linkedin Mpush-FCM Mapp_SDK OAuth_External Understanding communication channels A \"Communication Channel\" represents the medium through which customers receive messages. Examples include SMS, push notifications, web engagement, and POS (Point of Sale) systems. Some sources may act as both a source and a communication channel. For instance, WeChat not only provides customer information but also serves as a communication channel. Communication channels can vary, and information may be collected from diverse sources. For instance, a customer's communication channel, such as WeChat, may exclusively come from the WeChat system. Overlapping scenarios may arise where the source and communication channel are the same, while in other cases, they can be different. The system is designed to handle these variations effectively. Supported communication channels The entity supports the following communication channels: WeChat Mobile iOS Line Email WhatsApp Android Postmail Managing customer lifecycle with customer status A customer status defines the relationship between a brand and a customer. For example, a customer who interacts often with the brand can be defined as an active customer. Further, these statuses can be used to run the loyalty program and assign coupons, reward points etc accordingly. For example, more offers can be offered to a customer to make an inactive customer to active customer.. Activating customer status To activate customer status for your organisation, navigate to Organisation settings> Miscellaneous> Customer Status configuration and select the Enable customer status check box. On enabling the customer status, the existing fraud status will be replaced by the customer status function. Types of customer statuses The various customer statuses available in the Capillary platform that you can configure are: Active Suspended Deleted Fraud suspected Fraud confirmed Internal Pending deletion Creating a custom label You can click the Create new label option in the customer label and enter a new label name to assign a custom name for the status. You can add multiple labels if required. The first status label that you create is set as the default status value. Active customer status The active status can be used to indicate that the customer is active. 📘 NOTES: There are no restrictions for customers with Active status. All customers are marked Active by default. Suspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed, and Internal customer status You can restrict the following operations for the users with Suspended, Fraud suspected, Fraud confirmed or Internal status. Restriction Description Block coupons redemption Restrict from redeeming coupons. Block issual of loyalty promotions Restrict from receiving points. Block identifier change and account merge Restrict from account merging and identifier change requests. Block issual of badges This is a future development feature. Block issual of coupons Restrict from providing coupons. Block enrollment into loyalty promotions This is a future development feature. Block points allocation Restrict from providing points. When this restriction is added on any label, then the points allocation from any points-related action (like transaction point allocation, allocation points, target point allocation, issue to the referrer, issue to referee, goodwill points, import profile) will be blocked for the customer. Block points redemption Restrict from redeeming points. Block tier upgrade Restrict from tier upgrade. Block transaction Restrict future transactions. Mark transaction outlier Mark the transactions made by the selected label(s) as outliers. To restrict access, select the individual status labels or all the created status labels from the desired restriction drop-down. Click Select , and then click Update . Deleted customer status The deleted status allows you to block every action for customers with this status. To configure restriction, from the Block everything drop-down, select the individual custom labels or select all labels created for Deleted. Click Select and then click Update . Pending deletion customer status This status is used to indicate the status of customers for whom a deletion request is raised. For Pending Deletion , whenever a PII deletion request is triggered, a label Deletion_pending is automatically created and assigned to the customer, regardless of any other label that may have been created and set as default. Managing subscription A subscription refers to the voluntary action taken by customers to either opt in or opt out of receiving promotional or transactional communications from specific sources within the organization. You can configure the promotional and transactional subscription settings for a customer according to their preferences. For more information, refer to the Subscription management documentation. You can also view and set the subscription statuses on the customer's profile on Member Care . Managing loyalty status A customer can be of two types: a loyalty customer and a non-loyalty customer. A loyalty customer is a registered member of your organization's loyalty program, while non-loyalty customers are those who have not enrolled in your loyalty program but have subscribed using their mobile number or email ID with the organization. Transactions for these customers are tagged to their respective identifiers (mobile number/email ID). You can define the loyalty type of a customer during customer registration or while adding a transaction . The loyalty status of a customer is displayed on the Customer status in the customer's Member Care profile. Managing test and control status The customer list is split into a test and control group. Customers in the test audience group receive campaign communications, while those in the control audience group do not. The test and control statuses are displayed based on the group to which they belong. These statuses are maintained by the brands or auto-assigned and can be changed either through Member Care or Connect+ . Managing fraud status You can configure the fraud management and the statuses as per your requirements. For more information on fraud management, refer to the Fraud management documentation . 📘 Note If customer status is enabled, the fraud status will be superseded by the customer status.

Setup customer status For configuring customer status, refer to the Activating customer status section . Dual eligibility The Dual Eligibility feature allows you to register multiple users with the same secondary identifiers. When the Dual Eligibility feature is enabled, only one identifier is considered the primary identifier and the rest of the identifiers are considered for communication. The primary identifier for both of these profiles must be unique. Example: Consider a brand user who is registered on the platform using Email [email protected] , Mobile 123-456-7890 (primary identifier), and External ID ABC123. With the Dual Eligibility feature enabled, another user can be registered again using Email [email protected] and External ID ABC124. Notes: For the users registered with Dual Eligibility, the information about the user can be retrieved only using the primary identifier. Use Case User John : Works for Employer A and registers on the employer’s healthcare App with: Email : [email protected] Mobile : 123-456-7890 John’s Spouse, Jane : Works for Employer B and registers her family on the healthcare App. During registration: She adds John as a dependent using the same email ( [email protected] ) but a different mobile number 456-123-123) . Outcome : Two unique profiles are created for John: One is associated with Employer A (where John is the primary user). Another is associated with Employer B (where John is a dependent under Jane’s profile). Enabling dual eligibility To enable dual eligibility for an organization, create a JIRA ticket to the Product Support team and enable the configuration CONF_INSTORE_V2_ENABLED. In addition, make sure that the below configurations are configured as per the table: Configuration Name Configuration CONF_REGISTRATION_PRIMARY_KEY External ID or mobile or email CONF_REGISTRATION_PRIMARY_KEY_REQUIRED 1 - Enable CONF_ALLOW_REGISTRATION_FROM_ANY_IDENTIFIERS 0 - Disable CONF_USERS_IS_MOBILE_REQUIRED 0 - Not required FAQs Q: Is dual eligibility applicable for both loyalty and non-loyalty users? A: Dual eligibility is applicable only for Loyalty users. Q: Is it applicable to all types of orgs such as connected orgs, standard orgs, and Org Units? A: The dual eligibility feature applies to all the orgs. Q: Can we migrate users with the same secondary identifiers and unique primary identifiers? A: Yes. You can migrate. Q: What happens if I register a customer with the same primary identifier and other identifiers but a different source? A: The customer gets merged, and on MemberCare, you will be able to see both registration sources.

Then, assign a ticket to the Platform team requesting to enable Org Units for the org. Once the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have a user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level. This article covers the following topics. Define Organization structure : This includes zones, concepts, store-servers, stores, and store-tills. Organization Users : This includes registering admin users for your organization, creating user roles, and assigning user roles to define the scope of accessibility for each user to your organization's data. Before starting with the organization setup, you need to understand the basic terminologies used in the hierarchy. Concept : These are a logical grouping of stores for a single brand org. For example, groceries, electronics, apparel, and home appliances; and logical separation of brands in case of multi-brand org. For example, if an org ABC is into different verticals (say a supermarket, retail, and electronics as brands), each brand can have its own account through concept hierarchy. The following are the features of the Org Unit (OU). Users and access management at the OU level. Campaign and loyalty program creation at OU level. Reports (Insights+) at OU level. View customer information at the OU level. 📘 Note Customer registration remains the same across org. For example, a customer registered in an org unit will be registered automatically in all other org units. Hence, the registration date remains the same across org units. Zones : These are a geographical grouping of stores. For example, north, south, east, and south-east. Store Server: It is a local server for a store. The data captured by InStore is first saved in the store-server and from there the data will sync to the main server. Tills are associated to Store Server. However, Store Server is not required for Tills with an internet connection. Stores: These are usually the branches or outlets of an organization or you can say a physical store. Till/Store Till: A Till is a POS machine where the billings happen. A store can have one or more Tills. All the tills should be connected to the store-server through LAN and hence no internet is required at the till level to sync data to the store-server. However, store-server communicates with the main server over the internet. The hierarchy of an organization is as follows - Zones > Stores (Stores can be grouped independently by zones and concepts) > Store Servers > Store Tills. Stores are geographically grouped using zones and can also be logically grouped using the concept. Hence, a store can be for a zone or for a combination of a zone and a concept. Org hierarchy An org hierarchy can have up to 5 levels including Tills. In the hierarchy, Till is the lowest level and you can create other levels depending on the org structure. Login to InTouch of your cluster and follow these steps. Create Concept Create Zone Create Store Add Store Server Add Till Create concept You can use concepts for logical grouping for single-brand orgs, and as org units for multi-brand orgs. The creation process remains the same for both. If you need to have concepts as org units, after creating concepts, log a ticket to enable org units for your org and assign it to the Platforms team. 📘 Note Once the Org Unit (OU) is enabled for the org, you can have user role management, loyalty program, audience filters, and reporting at the OU level. To create a concept, follow these steps. Navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Concepts . Click Add New Concept . Fill in the details based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit. Code : A unique code for the zone. Name : Name of the zone. Description : Short description of the zone. Parent Concept : Choose the parent concept for the concept if any. For example, if you are creating a concept Apparel, you can have sub-concepts as men apparel, kids’ apparel women apparel and so on. * Default Language : The default language used for the concept. Default Currency : The default currency used across the concept. Default Time Zone : The default time zone of the concept. Similarly, you can create any number of concepts required for the org. Create zone The following procedure guides you in creating zone hierarchy Navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Zones . Click Add New Zone . Fill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click Create Zone . Code : Enter a unique zone code in apha-numeric. Name : Enter a name for the zone. For example, North Description : Enter a short description of the zone. Parent Zone : Tag a parent zone for child zones. For example, if you want to create the India-east zone under the India zone. Then the parent zone for India-east will be India. Default Language : Default language that you want to associate with the zone (regional language). Default Country : Country of the zone. Default Time Zone : Preferred time zone. Similarly, create the entire zone hierarchy for your organization. Create Store Stores are the second level from the bottom in the hierarchy. A store can be associated with a zone and concept. To create a store, follow these steps. Navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Stores . Click Add New Store . Fill in the fields based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit . Store Code : The store code to be identified in Capillary Cloud. It is recommended to use the following format for store code. .... Store Name : Name of the store you want to register. The store name must be unique within the cluster. You cannot use the same name across organisations in the same cluster. 📘 Note Note: The UI does not support the addition of special characters in the store name. Special characters in the store name can only be added when adding stores using the data import option. Store Description : Short description of your store. Parent Store : The parent store for the store. You can create child stores for a parent store. This option displays the list of all the stores you have registered for your organization. Parent Concept : The logical group (Concept) of the store. Store Default Language : The language used at the store. Store Default Currency : The base currency at the store location (currency of the country where the store is located). Store Default Time Zone : The geographical location of the store. All the zones created for your organization is displayed in the drop-down. Access Group : Access group to which the store has access. All the tills under the store inherit the access group of the store and will have access to the APIs accordingly. You can also assign a default access group for all the stores under your organisation. For information on access groups, see Access group . Store Code Representation for the Org : The external id of your brand. External ids.This should be unique and should not be a used external code. Set the Admin Type : Set this as General for a live store. If you would like to test the store before making it live, choose Admin . Similarly, you can create all the required stores for your org. Add Store Server In stores where PoS machines do not have access to the internet, you will have a store server that has an internet connection. All POS machines (or TILLs) are connected to the store server through LAN. A store will usually have one store server. To add a store server, follow these steps. Navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Store Servers . Click Add New Store Server . Enter the store server details based on the description provided in the following table and click Submit . Store : The store to which store-server needs to be configured. Store Server Username : Enter the username of the store-server provided by Capillary for that particular store. Store Server Password : Enter the password of the store server provided by the Capillary for that specific store. Confirm Password : Reenter the password of the store server. Similarly, you can add all the necessary store servers required for your brand. Add Till TILL is a PoS machine and is the last entry in the org hierarchy. Each TILL needs to be mapped to a store. You also need to map to a store server, for models where TILLs have no internet access. To add a new TILL, follow these steps. Navigate to Profile > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Store Masters > Store Tills . Click Add New Till . Enter TILL details based on the description provided in the following. Click Submit to save your changes and create the Till. Store : The store to which store-till needs to be assigned. Store Server : Store Server for the till. This acts as a local server for the POS machine (Store Till). Till Name : Username of the In-Store application for that till. The name must start with a lowercase letter ( a – z ). The rest can include lowercase letters, digits, dot ( . ), underscore ( _ ), or hyphen ( - ). Uppercase letters and other special characters are not allowed. The name must be at least 3 characters long. The Till name specified will also be copied to Till code in the backend. Till Description : Description for the till, if any. Till Password : The password of the In-Store application for that till. Confirm Password : Reenter the password of the In-Store. Similarly, you can add all the TILLs required for the org.

CONF_CURRENCY_CONVERSION_ENABLE Check this to enable currency conversion BILL_OUTLIER_BASKET_SIZE_LIMIT An outlier is an observation (or configuration) to identify abnormal behavior in bills. This option lets you set the basket size limit for a bill. Any number beyond this will be considered as an outlier bill. For example, if you set BILL_OUTLIER_BASKET_SIZE_LIMIT as 20, any bill with basket size more than 20 is considered as an outlier bill. Set -1 if the outlier is not applicable to your organization. AMOUNT_ROUNDING_OFF_TO_DECIMAL_PLACES This configuration specifies the number of decimal places to retain for transaction values. For example, if you set it to 2 decimal places and a transaction value is 100.567, the system will store the value as 100.56. This setting also applies to line-item transactions. Note: If the Decimal Places for Base Currency in the billing configuration is defined, the system always prioritizes this setting. In the above example, if Decimal Places for Base Currency is set to 1, the system will store the value as 100.6. Add payment modes A payment mode will have attributes and attribute values.

Basically, whenever a transaction happens, the bill comes to the capillary system and will be processed. However, sometimes, in those transactions, we might get: Line item that is not present in the master list Payment method that is not registered in the system Stores whose details are not yet added in the capillary system Missing transaction extended field Missing customer extended field Whenever these situations occur, those transactions will be stopped from processing (rejected), and will be moved to a centralised sanity queue instead based on below. After this enhancement, the handling will be as below: If they are of 1st, 2nd, 3rd type, they will be moved to the sanity queue. If they are of 4rth, 5th type: If they are of enum (basically a bunch of options), they will be moved to the sanity queue. For all the other types, they will be marked as failed permanently. Remember, all these transactions will be marked either as “pending” or “failed” as per above flow. All these configurations need to be enabled by the brands, otherwise the system will default to current behavior. Once these transitions are moved to the sanity queue, an event notification will be sent to the respective brands notifying them that we have received these types of transactions. Brands can fetch these transactions from APIs too to check about them as per their policies (daily, weekly, etc..) In the event notification that will be sent to brands, it contains following information: Event name Event datetime Bill number Customer identifier Rejection type, .i.e., can be reprocessed or not Reason of the rejection Source details of the bill Brands can get these transactions from API based on: Rejection type All pending transactions for a customer Then brands need to provide the new data points (new line items, new payment methods, new store, new extended field values) that can be considered for transactions to Capillary. Once they are updated in the Capillary system, all these transactions in the sanity queue will be re-processed once again by our capillary system. During the reprocessing, the process will happen based on the processed date not the original bill date. The APIs involved in this entire sanity queue are following: getRejectedTransactions: Fetches all the rejected transactions for the org, based on the input query params. retriggerTransactionAdd: Checks and updates the status of rejected Transaction. Retriggers the transaction add for the rejected transaction which are completely fixed. markFailed: Updates the rejected transaction status to PERMANENT_FAILED getReTriggerStatus: Gives the status of retriggered rejected transactions for the given retrigger Id API links will be available here: https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/getrejectedtransactions Updated 4 months ago Setup Transactions Setup Behavioral events Ask AI"

Behavioural Event is a platform that lets you create standard and custom events to capture customer activities across channels. After you create an event, whenever it is triggered, the payload containing the defined attribute information is sent to the webhook. The Behavioral Event framework listens to this event, validates it, and sends it to the corresponding destination such as loyalty, journey, etc. Objective The Behavioral Events data collected across sources can be used to develop personalized content, segment customers, or even incentivize customers. This product solves different use cases for different verticals. For example: In an offline retail or brick-and-mortar store, you can send coupons to customers for different events such as scanning a QR code of a particular product category, or showing interest in a particular item. This increases conversion without customers visiting the store again. In an e-commerce platform (website or app), customers can be engaged through games or quizzes. In the healthcare domain, customers can be rewarded for completing health-related activities to drive better engagement and loyalty of the customers. In Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG), customers can be rewarded for participating in sales promotion events. In the case of hospitality, you can send tailored messages to customers based on the stage of their purchase cycles such as inquiry, booking, check-in, and checkout. Modules that consume Behavioral Events Currently, events data can be consumed by Insights+ and Loyalty+. By default, Insights+ consumes any event that you create on Behavioral Events. However, you need to manually set if you want to consume by Loyalty+. Loyalty+ : This includes both loyalty and DVS (Dynamic Voucher System). Consumed by Loyalty Manager to send messages to customers or incentivize them based on events data. For example, you could send a message when a product a customer is looking for is of limited stock. Consumed by Bounceback Campaign to run engagement programs based on the events data. For example, you could send discount coupons on product abandonment or product add-to-cart events. Insights+ (upcoming feature) to analyze events data. For example, most searched products frequently searched products during a festival season. Types of Behavioral Events The following are two types of Behavioral Events available. Standard Events (Library of predefined events) : These are predefined events with all the required attributes and values. The following is the list of standard events. Administrators can enable events that are required for an organization. Product Removed From Cart, Customer Logged Out, App Installed, Product Added To Cart, Customer Registered, Category Viewed, Product Viewed, Customer Logged In, Coupon Applied, Product Searched, Coupon Denied, and App Uninstalled. Custom Events : If you want to capture a specific customer activity other than in Standard Events, you can create custom events with the event names, attributes, and values. The following table provides an understanding of choosing between standard and custom events. SCENARIO STANDARD EVENTS CUSTOM EVENTS Add standard attributes (such as SKU and Till) before publishing No Yes Edit standard attributes before publish No Yes Delete standard attributes before publishing No Yes Add standard attributes (such as SKU and Till) after publishing No No Edit standard attributes after publishing No No Delete standard attributes after publishing No No Add custom attributes (string, enum, double, date) before publishing Yes Yes Edit custom attributes before publishing Yes Yes Delete custom attributes before publishing Yes Yes Edit custom attributes after publishing No No Delete custom attributes after publishing No No Add custom attributes (string, enum, double, date) before publishing Yes Yes New terminologies Webhook Enables syncing and relaying data between third-party applications and the Capillary Server facilitating automated calls and real-time updates. WebEngage Multi-channel user engagement platform that lets you automate communications. Transformer Used to convert the payload sent by the third-party app to a payload understood by Capillary. In simple terms, it is a field mapping. Webhook Adapter Used to track real-time events data that consists of payload understandable by the Capillary system. Integration Automates pushing event data from a third-party app or website to the Capillary system. There are two types of integrations- WebEngage to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform with WebEngage. Custom integration to integrate Capillary Behavioural Events platform to any other third-party apps. Source Account Source in which a customer is registered. Example: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, InStore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, Ecommerce, Website, and Line. Event and Attribute Event is customer activity such as logging out, adding items to cart, and so on. Whereas, attributes are entries of an event that needs to be captured by our system. For example, for the event product review, you could have attributes like title and review message body. Standard Event A predefined event with a defined set of attributes. Custom Event A user-defined event that lets you define your own attributes that you want to capture. Standard Attributes The standard attribute in a behavioural event system is a default attribute that will be applicable for all the events. There are two standard attributes, eventDateTime and storeUnitID . These attributes need not be defined during the creation of an event and are applicable for all events by default. storeUnitID - This attribute is used only for internal usage. eventDateTime - This is a standard attribute that captures the event processing time. If a value is sent for the eventDateTime attribute, such as 2024-03-24 12:00:00, it serves as the timestamp for the event. However, if no value is sent or the attribute is missing in the payload, the time of event processing becomes the event timestamp. The formats that are acceptable for the eventDateTime attribute are given below: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss yyyy-MM-dd dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss yyyy/MM/dd dd-MM-yyyy MM/dd/yyyy yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss dd-MMM-yy yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy MMMM,dd,yyyy MMMM,dd yyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss 📘 Note The Behavioural event system saves the value for the eventDateTime attribute in the system as is, without any timezone offset. If there is no value provided for the attribute, it processes the time according to the GMT timezone and saves the datetime value without the timezone offset. Custom Attributes The custom attributes are user-defined attributes for each event. You can define attributes such as customer ID, product code, booking ID, product category, etc., and map the fields to capture the corresponding information. For example, you can create an attribute named CustomerMobileNumber and map it to Customer ID > Mobile number. These attributes can be of any of the following data types: Enum Group ID Till Code Coupon Code Customer ID Date Product SKU Product Brand Currency Code Product Category String Double Event routing in Connected Organizations When a customer performs an action, two events are generated—one for the child organization and one for the parent. Both events are delivered to the parent organization’s webhook and have unique event IDs. To enable centralised routing, the app sends all behavioural events to the parent webhook. The event payload includes a custom attribute called orgResolver , which contains the childOrgId . The parent webhook uses this ID to route each event to the correct child organization. The child org then processes the event and applies the relevant logic—for example, awarding reward points. How it works The app sends all behavioural events to the parent organization’s webhook . The event payload includes a custom attribute named orgResolver , which contains the child organization ID . The parent webhook reads the childOrgId and routes the event to the appropriate child organization. The child organization processes the event and applies any relevant logic (e.g., awarding reward points). { \"event_flag\": 5.19, \"event_name\": \"clickEventPromoPoint\", \"identifier_value\": \"unionId918871834592\", \"eventDateTime\": \"2023-12-11 12:13:14\", \"orgResolver\": { \"type\": \"PARENT_CHILD_ORG\", \"childOrgId\": 1115, \"tillCode\": \"12342\" //child till code } } Example: Multi-org health app A health app is used by employees across 400 companies. Instead of configuring 400 webhooks, the app: Sends all events to a parent org webhook . Uses Neo to map the customer to the correct organization. Adds the childOrgId to the event payload using the orgResolver attribute. The parent webhook routes the event to the correct child organization. The child organization processes the event and awards points accordingly. Mapping Also called attribute mapping that lets you map attributes of a behavioural event with the attributes of a third-party application. Limitations of Behavioral Events The following are the limitations of Behavioral Events. No support for standard entities such as SKU, and category in filters and KPIs for custom events. No support for anonymous events, customer identifier is required. Data is captured only from predefined integrations (such as WebEngage or Webhook), and not directly from sources (such as eCommerce websites, apps, and WeChat). The platform registers customers from the registered user profiles data shared in the S3 bucket. If there is no WebEngage integration, customer registration needs to handle through API Integration. Limitations for Custom Events: A maximum of 10 active events are allowed in an org. A maximum of 20 attributes are allowed in an event. Custom attribute names can have only up to 50 characters. Custom attributes can have only enum, date, Boolean, integer, double, and string as data types. Steps to configure and publish an event Create a Webhook integration for a WebEngage platform or any other third-party apps or platforms. Create a new custom event or add a standard event. Create attribute mapping. Run a sample test to validate whether the data is flowing correctly as desired. Publish the event. Add Webhook Integration Webhook facilitates pushing real-time data from a third-party application or website to the Capillary database through a web callback or HTTP push API. A Webhook integration is a combination of a third-party app and Till code. For every Webhook integration you create, a unique URL is generated. The respective third-party apps need to make a POST call to the URL passing events data. There are two types of integrations WebEngage integration to capture events data from the WebEngage platform. Custom integration to capture events data from other platforms or apps other than WebEngage. To create a Webhook integration, follow these steps. Click Create Webhook . Choose WebEngage for WebEngage integration, else choose Custom for integration with other apps. In Select till code , choose the Till code that you want to associate with the selected source. If an event has the attribute Till Code , then the Till Code that is captured for the event will be considered as a default one. Click Done You need to use the integration URL to POST event data to Webhook through an API call. 📘 If an event has the Till Code attribute, then the till code tagged in the Webhook or any other integration will not be considered. Webhook Configuration for Behavioural Events in Connected Organizations In a Connected organization setup, you only need to configure the webhook at the parent organization level. The system automatically routes events from both the parent and all connected child organizations to this webhook. Key Behaviours Single webhook setup - Configure the webhook only in the parent organization. No separate setup is required in the child organizations. Event routing - All behavioural events, whether triggered in the parent or a child organization, are routed to the parent’s webhook. Processing order - Events are first processed in the child organization where they originated. The same event is then processed again at the parent level. Child-only webhooks - If a webhook is set up only in a child organization (outside the connected org setup), it processes events locally . These events are not sent to the parent webhook. If needed, you can enable listening to child events when setting up the parent webhook . Add & map custom event Create custom events if you want to capture specific details that are not available in standard events. You can use both standard and custom attributes to create custom events. The following are the steps involved in publishing a custom event. To create a custom event, follow these steps. Log on to InTouch Go to > Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events . Click + Add Events. Click Create New Event and follow these steps In Event Name , specify a name for the event without any space or special characters (except underscore). For example, DemoEvent. If there are spaces in the event name, the system automatically replaces the spaces with a double underscore. Hence, do not use double underscores while naming the event. In Display Name , specify a name that you want to be displayed. In Description , give a short description of the event. Click + Add Attribute to add event attributes and follow these steps. In Name , specify an appropriate name for the attribute. Customer Identifier is a mandatory attribute for a custom event . In Data Type , choose the type of the attribute. TYPE DESCRIPTION CUSTOMER IDENTIFIER* (MANDATORY) This is a mandatory attribute for an event and is used to identify an existing customer and also to register a new customer if required. You need to configure identifier type, source, and associated source account. Customer Identifier : Choose the identifier type from the available options - Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, userId, Martjack ID. Source : Choose the source from which you want to identify customers. Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources. Source Account : For sources with multiple accounts, such as WeChat or Facebook, choose the desired account to identify registered customers from that source account. Add customer if not available : Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event. For example, if you set customer identifier as email ID, and Source as InStore, when an email id that is already registered on InStore is identified, the data is tagged to the customer and saved in the Capillary system when a new email id identified, the customer will be first registered if Add customer id not already present is enabled. The event details are tagged to the customer before saving the data. Enum Choose this to capture the predefined values for the attribute. In POSSIBLE VALUES enter the supported values for the field separating each by a comma (do not leave space after a comma). For example, if Name is Hobby, you could have the values Music, Sports, Fishing, Archery, Gardening, Others. Enum is a data type consisting of a set of predefined values. Till Code Choose this to capture Till codes. Coupon Code Choose this to capture coupon codes and configure the Regex (regular expression) for coupon codes accordingly. A customer identifier attribute is required for any custom event. Choose this to capture customer identifiers, associated sources, and source accounts from which the event is triggered. NOTE *: Customer Identifier capturing is mandatory for custom events. You cannot save an event without this attribute. CUSTOMER IDENTIFIER *: Mobile number, email ID, external id, WeChat ID, Martjack ID. SOURCE *: Facebook, WebEngage, WeChat, Instore, Martjack, TMall, Taobao, JD, e-Commerce, Website, Line, and other sources. SOURCE ACCOUNT *: For sources with multiple accounts such as WeChat and Facebook, choose the account that you want to associate with the attribute. ADD CUSTOMER IF NOT AVAILABLE *: Enable this option to automatically register new customers (in the loyalty program) that are captured through the event. Date Choose this to capture date values. The following are the different date formats supported. yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S, yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy-MM-dd, dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss, MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss, yyyy/MM/dd, dd-MM-yyyy, MM/dd/yyyy, yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss, dd-MMM-yy, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss, EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy, MMMM,dd,yyyy, MMMM,dd, and yyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ss. Product SKU Choose this to capture product SKUs or item codes. Product Brand Choose this to capture product brands. Product Category Choose this to capture product categories. String Choose this to capture free-flowing text that could contain alphabets, numbers, and spaces. Double Choose this to capture a double data type. Double is a 64-bit floating value with precision up to 15 decimal places_. Enable Required if the attribute is a required field for the event. Enable Is part of unique key , if you want the attribute to be a part of unique key. For information on uniqueness check, see Event uniqueness check . Any attribute that is made as part of the unique key, cannot be reverted to a non-unique field. Enable Is PSI data , if you want to classify the attribute as sensitive data. This is applicable for attributes that are of type Enum, String, and Double. Refer to the PSI data documentation for more information on classifying PSI data . Similarly, click + Add Attribute to create more attributes for the event. Click Next to continue Check EMF Consumer to show the event in Loyalty Manager, and Bounceback Campaign to reward points, coupons, or just send messages. By default, these events are consumed by Essential Insights. In the Add destination page, select the Loyalty check box to send the event to Loyalty and process it. If it is not selected, the event is not sent to Loyalty and will not be considered for any points, rewards or any other loyalty program. By default, the Loyalty check box is not selected. You must manually select this option to send the event to Loyalty and Journey. Click Done to save the event. Test the event to see whether data is flowing to the system as expected. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process. For detailed instructions, see Test & Publish Event. 📘 The Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually. Click Publish to publish the event. 📘 Once the event is published, you cannot edit or delete either standard or custom attributes. After creating, testing, or publishing the custom event successfully you can map it with the source event. For details, refer to mapping custom events to source events. Enabling uniqueness check In behavioural events, you can enable uniqueness checks and avoid issuing reward points for duplicate events. After the uniqueness check, duplicate events are not deleted nor does the Behavioral Event framework reject it. The EMF identifies duplicate events by checking their uniqueness. If there is a duplicate event, it is not processed. This ensures that points are not provided for duplicate events. Use case A behavioural event comes to Capillary from WebEngage and the timeout set for this request is 5 seconds at WebEngage. If Capillary fails to respond within 5 secs, WebEngage triggers the same request again. The uniqueness check enables to identify the duplicate events and avoids issuing reward points for duplicate events. To enable uniqueness-check in the behavioural events, perform the following: Enable the uniqueness check configuration in the webhook. There is no UI to enable uniqueness check configuration in the webhook and this must be performed using the webhook API call. For new orgs, use the POST call and create a webhook with uniqueness check configuration or create a webhook using UI and use PUT API call to update the webhook. For more information, see Add webhook and Update webhook . For existing orgs, use PUT API call and update the webhook to enable the uniqueness check. 📘 Notes: Once enabled, you cannot disable the unique check configuration. Once uniqueness check is configured for the webhook, all the events in the org should have uniqueness check enabled. In the events page, use the toggle switch and add the desired attributes to unique key. You can do this using API or from the UI. To add it from the UI, Enable the Is part of unique key switch. By default, the event name and customer identifier form the unique key. If an attribute is enabled, it is added as a part of the unique key with the event name and customer identifier. Unique key format : EventName_Customerid_Attribute1_Attribute2_.... Unique key : md5 hash generated from combining the event name, customer identifier, and additional attributes in the EventName_Customerid_Attribute1_Attribute2 format. Example Consider the following scenario: Event name: Appointment Customer ID: 9123456789 Custom attribute for the event: refID In this scenario, the unique key format is Appointment_9123456789_refID, and the unique key is 779069e41a8afde74b2c526bce59e51a, which is the MD5 hash of Appointment_9123456789_refID. Make sure that the Required switch gets enabled. The unique key attributes are marked automatically when we enable the unique key switch. 📘 Once the attribute is enabled as part of the unique key, it cannot be disabled. By default, the event name and customer identifier are part of the unique key and the enabled attribute is added as a part of the unique key along with the event name and customer identifier. Map custom event to source event There are some instances where events that come to Capillary's system are not in a format supported by Capillary. For example, the Capillary does not support an event name with a blank space. Suppose an event named Promotion Viewed is coming from WebEngage (source). You need to create a custom useevent - promotionViewed (custom event name) and map it to Promotion Viewed (source event name) using the event mapping process. Behavioral Events lets you map a custom event to a source event. You can do it at any phase - after creating, testing, or publishing a custom event. You can map the source event name and attributes to a custom event name and attributes stored in Capillary's system. The following are the different stages of event publishing when you can map a custom event to a source event. Create custom event To create a custom event, follow these steps. Navigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events. In the All Events tab, click + Add Event On the Add Events page, click + Create New Event to create, test, and publish a custom event with attributes. Map custom events and their attributes To map a custom event to a source event, follow these steps. Navigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events. In the All Events tab, search the existing or newly created custom event using the event name. Click + Add Mapping to map the custom event with the source event. On the Add Mapping page, choose the source (For example, WebEngage or Custom). Once you save mapping details, you cannot change the source. In Event Name , enter the event name of the source to map to the custom event name. Enter the source's event attribute to map the custom event and the source event attributes. Click Save . View and modify a custom event To view and edit mapping, follow these steps. Navigate to Organization Settings > Master Data Management > Data Model > Behavioral Events. In the All Events tab, search your preferred custom event using the event name. Click on the mapped custom event and navigate to the Mappings tab to view the event mapping. Navigate to the Mappings tab, click the Edit icon. Modify the mapping as You can modify the event name and event attributes - the event name and source attributes. The system does not allow to change the source. Click Save . Add a Standard Event In Source , select the source of the event. For now, only WebEngage is supported. In Event Name, specify your preferred name for the event. In Attributes, enter the name of each attribute as in the Source(WebEngage). The attributes on the left refer to the names as in the Capillary system. Test the event to see whether data is flowing to the system or not. For example, for the Add to Cart event, open the WebEngage portal, and try adding items to the cart. The system will automatically validate the data and complete the testing process. 📘 The Publish button will be active only once the page is refreshed after pushing the event's data to the system. You need to refresh the page manually. Click Publish to publish the event Test & Publish Event By default, an event that is created will be in draft mode. Once the event is tested successfully and if the data is flowing as desired, you can publish the event to make it live. For testing an event, you need to either pass the data in the supported format or in the code from where you want to implement or through API. Test event data using API Below is the flow chart showing the steps involved in testing an event. Here are the steps to test an event using API. On the Behavioral Events home page, in the All Events tab, search for the event that needs testing and click on the event name. The events attribute page opens. On the event attributes page, go to the { } Code tab. Copy the payload of the event. Open an editor like Notepad to edit the payload. Fill in the correct values of the fields. This payload is used as the request payload to Post Event API. On the Behavioral Events home page, go to the Webhook tab and create a new custom Webhook or copy the URL of an existing custom Webhook. 📘 Note Create a custom Webhook URL. When selecting the integration under the Select Integration drop-down, choose Custom . POST the event using the webhook URL and the event payload. Validate if the data flow of the event is successful using the Get Events Logs API. The message and status fields indicate if the POST call was a success. Refresh the Behavioral Events home page. The status changes from Testing Pending to Publish. Click Publish to publish the event. Validate event publishing in Member Care UI. From the customer home page, navigate to Events > Behavioral events to see the event published. Timezone in behavioural events Scenario 1: Behavioural Event payload without eventDateTime value. Description: The system processes event times using GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). For instance, if an event is logged at 6 PM IST (Indian Standard Time), the system records the processing time as 12:30 PM GMT. Scenario 2: Behavioural Event payload with eventDateTime eventDateTime value Description: The system considers the date mentioned by the user in the specified format. This can be used in scenarios where you want to capture a past-dated event. Example: For example, 2024-08-05T14:30:5.3 if the date format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:s.S Reporting Behavioural events created within the system are automatically onboarded into the Insights database once the data is pushed into the event. After an organization is onboarded to the automated Behavioral Events (BE) flow, the data corresponding to all the BEs will be available for reporting within 24 hours after completion of ETL sync. This would allow the users to create normal charts and migration charts powered on BE data. Audience Filters As soon as a behavioural event is created and its data is available in Insights, an audience filter is available in Engage+ for segregating users and creating an audience group . For more information on audience filter-based reporting, refer to the Audience group filter in reports documentation.

For example, you can have card series for Digital and Physical Card. A card series contains information such as card series name, card type, card number configuration details, and expiry details. You can also extended fields for cards. You can either have auto-generated cards or manually generated cards. Card linked loyalty program: Card linked loyalty enables creating loyalty programs for each card series. This is applicable only for MLP enabled orgs. If a loyalty program is created based on card series, you cannot create another program based on zone or concept. Features The following are the features of the Card Series module. Create physical and digital card series for an org. Create a card series with either auto-generated card numbers or manually generated card numbers. Auto-assign card numbers to customers during registration or first transaction after card-series creation. Manually issue cards to customers through member care and integration platform (APIs). Issue one or more cards to customers from a card series. Create a separate loyalty program for each card series . Terminologies in card module There are a few terminologies that you need to know before starting card configuration. Card series : The card series represents different card types of an organization. For example. Value card, Premium card, Digital card, Physical card, and more. A card series stores information such as card series name, how to create card numbers for the card series, whether the card can expire and after how many days, and more. The following is the information stored in the card series. Card series name Card series code Card number generation configuration Card expiry configuration Card : This represents a card from a card series issued to a customer. A card stores information such as when the card was issued, when will it expire, from which store or source account the card was issued, and more. A customer can have multiple cards of the same card series. The following information is stored at the card level. Card expiry date Card issue date Card status Store code (where the card is registered) Card status : A card has a system-defined status code and a user-defined status label. Internal validations and out-of-box functionalities such as card-related KPIs use status codes and status labels. It also allows following different naming conventions to define card statuses. You can map multiple status labels to a status code. The system supports the following status codes. NOT_ISSUED : This card is not issued to any customer ACTIVE : The card is in an active status. SUSPENDED : The card is temporarily blocked but you can reactivate it. If the card number is used as an identifier, you cannot make any transaction or redeem points and vouchers using the card in this status. DELETED : You can modify nothing in a card with this status. You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption. EXPIRED : You cannot use this card in transactions, points, or voucher redemption. You cannot change the status as well. The following are examples of status labels. Card Assigned status label mapped to ACTIVE status code Card Blocked status label mapped to SUSPENDED status code. New Card status label mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code. Card Generated Card Printed and Card Distributed to Store’ multiple status labels mapped to NOT_ISSUED status code. Card Permanently Deleted’ status label mapped to DELETED status code. Card Expired status label mapped to EXPIRED status code. Card issue : Card issue means linking cards to customers. The following are the three possible scenarios that can happen during registration or post-registration. For details, see issue card to a customer A digital or virtual card is issued to the customer. A physical card generated in Capillary is issued to the customer. A physical card not generated in Capillary is issued to the customer. Card configurations (Org level) You need to configure the following card-related settings before creating the card series. Map standard status with preferred status labels. Create multiple status labels for each standard status. Set the maximum number of cards issued to a customer. To configure the card at the org level, follow these steps. Navigate to Organization Settings > Miscellaneous > Card Configurations . Click Modify global settings In the Maximum no. of active cards per customer , enter the value to set the maximum number of cards (total number of card series) for a customer. In Status Mapping , tag standard statuses to your preferred statuses (custom status labels). There are five different standard statuses - Not issued, Active, Inactive, Deleted, and Expired. To create and map a status label, follow these steps. a. Navigate to a status for which you want to add a custom status label. b. Click Create a new tag c. Enter a name for the status label. 📘 Once the tag(status label) is created and saved you cannot edit or delete the tag. d. Click on the newly created tag to make it the default tag. If only one tag(status label) is created for a status code, the system considers this tag as the default status tag. Click Update . 📘 After successfully configuring the card at the org level, create a card series , generate card numbers , and issue cards to customers . Counting Only Active Cards for Customer Limits To count only cards labeled as ACTIVE towards a customer's card limit, you can enable the configuration CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARD. Once enabled, only cards marked as ACTIVE will count towards the limit, while cards with statuses such as SUSPENDED or ISSUED will be ignored. By default this configuration is disabled. To enable the Configuration , raise a JIRA request to the Product Support team requesting activation of CONF_COUNT_ONLY_ACTIVE_LABEL_CARDS. 📘 Note Org Level: The system will count only cards labeled as ACTIVE when enforcing the maximum card limit for a customer. Card Series Level: Similarly, only ACTIVE cards will be counted when determining the limit within a card series. When merging two customer profiles, the system will count only ACTIVE cards from both profiles. Use case - A customer’s card limit is set to 5. When Configuration Disabled: The system counted ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, and ISSUED cards. If the customer had 3 ACTIVE, 1 SUSPENDED, and 1 ISSUED card, the system considered the total as 5, preventing additional card issuance. When configuration Enabled Only ACTIVE cards are counted. The customer now has 3 ACTIVE cards, so they can receive 2 more ACTIVE cards. Prerequisite Before configuring the card series, you need to set an org-related card configuration . Create card series To create a card series, follow these steps. Navigate to Organization Settings > Miscellaneous > Card Configurations Select the Cards tab. Click Create card series . In Name , enter the name of the card series. In Series code , enter a unique series code. It is recommended to use alphanumeric code. Once the card series is created, you cannot modify the series code. In Series type, choose the type of card series - Digital : A digital card is a modern version of the loyalty card. Customers can manage these loyalty cards through InTouch or mobile applications. You can generate and download card numbers for digital cards. Physical : A physical card is a traditional version of a loyalty card. You have to carry these cards to the store to redeem or issue points during or post-transaction.

Card-based program A group company issues multiple loyalty cards of that org and a customer could have one or more loyalty cards that they could use across countries. The loyalty benefits such as points balance, earning rules, redemption rules, and tiers - are associated with a loyalty card (and not a country). Multi-Currency and Multi-Country Programs Fields Description Bill Amount Captures in local currency and uses conversion ratio for local-to-base currency conversion. Bill Amount in Loyalty Captures only in base currency. Points Earning Points on a bill amount in on the base currency. Upgrade on Amount Earning of points/bill amount in base currency or based on the custom field of bill amount in local currency. Points Redemption across Programs Single redemption across programs with single points-to-currency conversion (upcoming) Points Redemption Discount Currency is not applicable for points discount. To configure and create loyalty programs for multi-brand orgs, follow these steps - Log on to InTouch and go to the Loyalty tab. You will see existing programs and an option to create a new program. Click +Loyalty Program . MLP workflow can be broadly categorized into the following three phases. Step 1: MLP Configuration Please note that there should be no overlap between any two programs. You can define the boundaries of a loyalty program either by a zone or concept hierarchy. If a loyalty program is defined on a concept basis, then all events originating from all tills of that concept will pass through its configured program. Default Program : A default program is created when we create an org in our system. All concepts and zones are mapped to the default program irrespective a separate program is running for that concept/zone. Step 2: Events For any event such as transaction and customer update, first, the relevant programs will be identified and then the configured rules and actions will be executed for that particular program. 📘 The default program will always be executed. If the event also matches with any other non-default program, that will also be executed Step 3: Get Details (API Call) Whenever any information such as Current points, tier, and a bulk call is required, either the calling module will pass the corresponding program or the system will identify the corresponding program from the configuration and pass the relevant value to the caller. Use Cases Points Allocation Strategy : Each program has its own points allocation strategies. A point allocation strategy can be created and used within a program. The allocation strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even within the Default Program. To know how to create Points Allocation Strategies, click here. Points Expiry strategy : Each program has its own points expiry strategy. A point expiry strategy can be created and used within a program. The expiry strategy of one point cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. To know how to create Point Expiry Strategy, click here. Points Redemption Strategy : Each program has its own points redemption strategy and points to currency conversion ratio. The redemption strategy of one program cannot be used in any other program, not even in the Default Program. Points redemption strategies can be created and used within a program. To know how to create point redemption strategies, click here. While making redemption, the caller has to specify from which program and how much point needs to be redeemed. Whenever a redemption call is made and the program id is not passed, the points will deduct from the program/till where the redemption call is made. Manage Trackers : Trackers created within a program can be used and evaluated within the program. It will work the same as in the case of a single loyalty program. Tracker of one program can not be used or evaluated in any other program, not even in the default program. To know more click here. Customer Registration : Customers once registered in any program by default will register across brands in the org but the enrollment will be done only for the program to which the till belongs. Enrollment in other brands will not happen till the customer makes a transaction in that program. Customer updates : Customer update events will pass through all the programs which as associated with the till from where the event is fired. So if the Org wants to allocate points to a brand loyalty program or a Default program, then they have to write rules on the brand loyalty program and Default program as well. Manage Tiers : Tiers for each program can be created within the program and they work within the program only. Click here to know more. Configure for Transaction event New Transaction : Once a transaction is made, the corresponding programs will be identified, and accordingly “new transactions” rules will execute. Transaction Update : Any transaction update event will only pass through the corresponding program that is configured for the till from which the update event is initiated. In case the transaction creates and transaction update tills are different then rules will run for the program where the transaction has originated. Transaction Return : For the Transaction return event, the rules will be executed from the program where the purchase was made, not where the return is made. For eg, the Customer transacted at till 1(Program 1) but return the products at till 3 (Program 2), in this case, the return rules will be executed from Program 1, not for Program 2. Configuring Rules/Sets Rule and set configuration need to be configured at the program level depending on the requirement. The rules configured for lifetime purchases, current points, no. of transactions, etc are always in the context of the program. For example, lifetime purchases are the purchases made in that program. For example, let's assume a customer has made 6 transactions across the organization in different tills/stores. If one writes a rule within program 1 on currentcustomer.lifetimepurchase, it will be evaluated on 1200, and on program 2 it will be evaluated on 900. Moreover, each program will have over customer KPIs such as Lifetime purchase, current points, lifetime points, trackers Visit count, and a number of transactions. One View of Customer One will be able to see program-wise (including Default Program) details of a customer with program-level KPIs in Member care and Binary. See the figure below. For eg, if a concept/till is not mapped in the Default program then the corresponding transaction/point will not be available in customer KPIs in Default Program. Limitations Currently, programs can run either at concept or zone but not both One concept/zone can only have one loyalty program (excluding the default program) Points can only be redeemed from one program at a time. Multiple Loyalty programs cannot run at the store level i.e. different programs at each store of the brand Product category/brand based loyalty program configurations are not available Multiple currencies are not supported across loyalty programs.

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An organisation can designate different roles to these members and incentivise them according to the organisation’s preference. User group loyalty allows an organisation to incentivise not only its customers but also other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which help an organisation to establish brand loyalty. In user group loyalty, an individual’s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded. For example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction. This way of incentivising the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact with an organisation. Key concepts The following are some of the key concepts of user group loyalty In B2B Loyalty, an org is identified as an entity. An individual can be part of multiple groups. 📘 You can configure the total number of groups that a member can be part of. The parent control or the admin role can be transferred from one member to another. Permissions to manage group benefits. A member of a group can still make individual transactions. All the members in a group can pool in their transactions for a tier upgrade. Points return and downgrade checks are supported in case of transaction return. Both the group and the individual can be incentivized when they transact while representing the group. Use Cases Following are the different scenarios where user group loyalty is applicable. B2B Loyalty Vertical Description Fleet Loyalty Fuel Brands can enroll fleet companies in their B2B loyalty programs. Fleet Drivers can earn loyalty points by purchasing fuel at retail outlets but points redemption can happen by fleet owners who are in the same group as the driver. Corporate Loyalty Programs Points earned by an employee of a company enrolled in a B2B loyalty program can be redeemed at the company level where other members of the company will also enjoy the benefits of the transaction made by a particular employee. CPG and Distributor Loyalty Programs A sales structure where existing distributors can recruit new distributors to sell the products. Distributors make money through a percentage of their recruits' sales and also direct sales of products to customers. Affiliate Marketing Programs The affiliate enrolled in the program can make customers buy products. With a product purchased by the customer, the rewards are accrued to the affiliate's account. New Terminologies 1. Company : Any business entity which is enrolled in the brand’s B2B loyalty program. Sub-company : A smaller business entity associated with a Company. For example, a big company like Tata can be registered as a company while Tata Motors, TCS can be registered as sub-companies. Customer Role : Role is used to capture the association between customer and company. A company can have customers in various roles. For example, a company enrolled in a fleet loyalty program of a brand can have customers in various roles like a driver, associate, owner, etc. 3. Customer Hierarchy : Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. To know how to create hierarchy using APIs, see Hierarchy 🚧 Note Friends and family usergroups are now deprecated.

An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An org can designate different roles to these members and incentivize them according to the org’s preference. User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize not only its customers but also incentivize other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which helps an org to establish brand loyalty. Configuring Hierarchy Customer hierarchy is used to capture the association between two customer roles. Hierarchy definition stores the required attributes for hierarchy creation (such as customer roles), validation rules for each role, group automation, and role-based loyalty permissions. An org can create multiple hierarchy definitions to capture its client companies’ organizational structures. Each company can have only one hierarchy. Once the hierarchy is set up, all the attributes and configurations created in the hierarchy will apply to the customers associated with the company. To create a new hierarchy, do the following. 📘 You can only add new roles and validation rules but cannot modify existing roles and rules. On InTouch , navigate to Organisation Settings > Hierarchy Configuration . Click New hierarchy definition . In Hierarchy definition name , enter a customized name for the hierarchy. In Hierarchy definition code , enter a unique code for the hierarchy identification. 📘 You cannot change an existing Hierarchy Definition Code. Click Next . In Roles , add all the relevant user roles in the hierarchy. 📘 At least two user roles are required to create a hierarchy and can extend up to eight roles. In Validation rules , define the association between two roles to maintain the hierarchical structure. 📘 Enable Skip role mapping allowed to allow skip level associations. For example, in a company, an associate can report to a zonal manager in the absence of the city manager. If disabled, hierarchy rules are strictly followed, and skip level associations are not possible. A user in the Child role can be associated with the user in the Parent role. Max no. of child customers, the maximum value that you can enter is 30,000. 📘 You can set up multiple associations by adding rules. A role can be configured as a parent role in only 1 rule. Similarly, a role can be a child role for only 1 rule. The same role cannot act as both parent and child roles. In Group Automation , Enable group automation to create groups implicitly. In Group creation based on, select the role on which the group is created. This role becomes the owner/admin of the group. Enable Automated member addition to automatically add all users associated with the admin to the group automatically. 📘 You can create only one rule with automatic member addition. In Group Permissions , provide role-based access control on loyalty actions like points redemption and points transfer. 📘 You can change Group Permissions for each role later. Click Create .

Create a JIRA ticket to the Insights team and create an audience filter for the extended field. Convert custom field to extended field Once you have the custom field created, raise a ticket to the Platforms team requesting the conversion to the extended field. Once it is created, you can use the field in reports and campaigns. However, the team verifies the request and decides whether to convert to the extended field. 📘 The team might reject the request if the custom field is too specific and does not make general sense. The platform team takes care of mapping custom field values to extended fields. Supported date formats in extended fields The extended fields support following date formats: yyyy-MM-dd yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601 with Z for UTC timezone) yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss+hh:mm (ISO 8601 with offset) Supported date formats and behaviour The table below explains the behaviour using an example specific to the India cluster. Input Format Example Value Interpretation Saved in DB (UTC) Shown in Member Care yyyy-MM-dd \"1986-07-15\" Time assumed as 00:00:00 UTC 1986-07-15T00:00:00.000+00:00 1986-07-15T05:30:00+05:30 yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ \"1986-07-15T00:00:00Z\" Exact UTC timestamp 1986-07-15T00:00:00.000+00:00 1986-07-15T05:30:00+05:30 yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ \"1986-07-15T14:30:00Z\" Exact UTC timestamp 1986-07-15T14:30:00.000+00:00 1986-07-15T20:00:00+05:30 yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss+05:30 \"1986-07-15T14:30:00+05:30\" Local time with offset 1986-07-15T09:00:00.000+00:00 1986-07-15T14:30:00+05:30 Custom Fields Custom fields are columns that store special or custom information related to customers, transactions, transaction line-items, coupons, and so on. As there is no control over the field values, it is difficult to run reports on custom fields. For example, if the custom field Gender has values M, F, and MF, it becomes difficult for an analyst to work directly on such data.

You're okay with partial input. For instance, typing just part of the mobile number or a fragment of the email ID should still return relevant results. Solution You can create a search filter with mobile OR email OR external ID condition. This is useful when you don’t have the full details but still want to pull up the right customer profile using whatever you’ve got. Use Case 2: Exact Match with AND Conditions You want to search for a customer using a combination of details— first name , date of birth , and city . In this case, you're doing a full search. You’ll enter the complete first name (e.g., Frodo ), the full date of birth, and the full city name (e.g., Mount Doom ). No partials. Solution You can create a search filter with first name AND date of birth AND city (requires exact match). This approach is ideal when you want to narrow down the results to an exact individual based on multiple known fields. Use Case 3: Exact Match with Optional Filter You want to search for a customer using first name , date of birth , and city . These are your primary fields and require an exact match. Additionally, you want to refine the search further using the zip code —but this field is optional. If provided, it’ll narrow down the results even more. Search Criteria: first name AND date of birth AND city zip code (optional) This is helpful when you have most of the key information but want to add another layer to reduce ambiguity in search results. Use Case 4: Primary ID with Optional Filters You’re looking for a specific transaction using the transaction (bill) number . To help limit the result set—especially if multiple systems or hotels use similar formats—you can add check-out date and hotel name as optional filters. Search Criteria: transaction number check-out date (optional) hotel name (optional) Use this when the transaction ID is the main identifier, but extra filters can help isolate the right record more quickly.

After creating a search filter, you can use the Copy cURL feature to import it into the API tool and run it. Core Concepts What is a Search Filter? A search filter is a set of one or more indexed fields used to quickly look up data. You define which fields to search on—this setup is called the search filter . There are two types of filters: AND filter – Returns results only when all the conditions are met OR filter – Returns results when any of the conditions are met (available only for the Customer entity) Once the filter is set, the system knows how to query the database efficiently. You can then use the Search API to fetch the results. Key Features Define the fields to search on—including custom and extended fields Set the time range for the data you want to query Supports partial search (starts with) for customer records Works across multiple languages Compatible with the Vulcan UI framework (but not limited to it) Choose which fields appear in the search results; use Neo for advanced customization Understanding Cardinality When creating a search filter, the system first checks the cardinality of the fields you've selected. Filters with high cardinality are more likely to pass validation and be activated. High Cardinality means the field (or combination of fields) has a large number of unique values. This makes it a strong candidate for indexing and searching. Example: Bill number —each value is likely unique. Low Cardinality means the field has only a few unique values. These fields aren’t ideal for filtering on their own. Example: Gender —only a handful of values like Male, Female, Other. A filter with only this field will likely fail validation. 👉 Note: Cardinality is calculated based on all mandatory fields in your filter. The filter must pass the cardinality check before it can be activated.
